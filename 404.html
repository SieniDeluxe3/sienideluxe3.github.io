        <p>errr... buddy, I think you're a bit lost...</p>
        <p>there ain't a file called like that.</p>
        <p>maybe there was and I just removed it.</p>
        <p>who knows.</p>
        <p>anyways, you can return to the home page with the link below.</p>
        <a href="index.html" id="hotlink">A wild home page appeared!</a>
        <p>if you want, you can also go back.</p>
        <a><input value="this is a back button" onclick="history.back()"></a>
